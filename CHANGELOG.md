# testo-plugin Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Rector rules carrying `#[\Testo\Bridge\Rector\Testing\TestRectorFixtures]` are recognized as test cases: gutter run
  icon, test-file icon, no "unused" warnings, and a run from the attribute that narrows to `--type=rector-fixture`.
  The rule's own public methods stay ordinary methods — only its fixtures are tests.
- Running a class-level attribute now narrows the run to that attribute's type (`#[Test]` → `--type=test`), while
  running the class itself stays untyped and keeps everything the class holds.
- Gutter run icon on `#[\Testo\Filter\Group]`: runs every test of that group with `--group=<name>` and nothing else —
  no path or name filter is added. A variadic `#[Group('db', 'slow')]` emits one `--group` flag per name.
- The Group / Exclude group fields of the run configuration accept several comma-separated names. Names are stored
  as a list, so a group name is passed to the CLI verbatim; configurations saved in the previous format are migrated
  on load.
- Inspection: suspicious `#[Group]` names are highlighted — blank or whitespace-padded, `!`-prefixed (the CLI reads
  that as an exclusion), containing a comma, or no names at all.

- Initial scaffold created from [IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template)
